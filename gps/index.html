<!-- 
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	The purpose of HTLM5 semantics tags is to give meaning to your page and be able to identify the most important parts of your page. It also helps when using a screen reader - for those with a disability or blindness. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	It starts with the most important section. For example, an <h1> element is of greater importance than an <h2> element.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	I learned what a snippet in Sublime is and how to create one. I will be creating snippets at a later date when I find a use for them. I think I will be using them when I start creating more detailed pages. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
	The concept that was most difficult was understanding the difference among the various semantics tags ex. <main>, <article>, <aside>, etc. and understanding how they will be presented/displayed to someone using a screen reader.
