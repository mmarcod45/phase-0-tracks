# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files and keeps records of time. Various versions of the project are kept and can be recalled with the help of version control. It is useful because it allows to reverse files back to a previous stage or even the entire project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is when a commit is made to the master branch. A branch represents a deviation from the original work that can potentially be merged back to the master branch. Creating a branch in Git is useful because it gives you a "copy" of your project to work on. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit creates a save point in Git and it records changes to your repository. 
Commit message example: "Add error message when entering invalid iput"
The message must be specific and include compatible wording. For example, use "Add" instead of "Added"
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict can occur if the master branch has changed since you started your feature. Any merge conflict needs to be addressed before a merge can be completed.
