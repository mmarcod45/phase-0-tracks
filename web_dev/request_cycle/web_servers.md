## Question 3 

VPS (virtual private server) - it is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers may have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS.

Advantages: 
- The subscriber has full access to the VPS's OS, with unrestricted root or administrator permissions.
- This level of access allows subscribers to configure the VPS to meet their own unique requirements.
- The subscriber may also opt to host additional services on the server, such as a File Transfer Protocol site, a mail server, or specialized applications and dependency databases for activities such as e-commerce and blogging.
- Another advantage to using a VPS is that it allows the subscriber to host multiple websites.

It is considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system for security reasons. An unauthorized user can gain access and obtain control of the system. It is adviced to avoid using the root account except when absolutely necessary.
